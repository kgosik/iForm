\title{Interaction Screening for Ultra-High Dimensional Data}
\usage{
iForm(data, response)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of your data with the response and all p predictors}

\item{response}{character name of the response column in the dataset}
}
\value{
a summary of the linear model returned after the selection procedure
}
\description{
Extended variable selection approaches to jointly model main and interaction effects from high-dimensional data orignally proposed by Hao and Zhang (2014) and extended by Gosik and Wu (2016).
Based on a greedy forward approach, their model can identify all possible interaction effects through two algorithms, iFORT and iFORM, which have been proved to possess sure screening property in an ultrahigh-dimensional setting.
}
\details{
Runs the iFORM selection procedure on the dataset and returns a linear model
of the final selected model.
